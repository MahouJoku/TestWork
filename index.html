        <img src="ArcsPicture.webp" width="300">
        <h2>Why I Enjoy Them</h2>
        <p>There is something about being in a space with friends and family, building strategies and interacting
            with one another that makes board games so exquisite.
        </p>
        <h3>Favorite Games So Far</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ark Nova</li>
            <li>Catan</li>
            <li>Wingspan</li>
            <li>Terraforming Mars</li>
        <h4>Another Reason</h4>
        <p>I also am bit of a collector when it comes to this hobby. There is just so much history within this hobby
            and so many experiences to be had that I feel like I'd want to catch up on.
